# OpenCV Playground

This repository contains codes I used to learn OpenCV, currently the code are a modification of the great blog "www.learnopencv.com", I list them here to documents what I have learnt. The copyright belongs to the great Satya Mallick. Thanks to the author's generosity for sharing his codes along with his lucid explanations. I basically hand coded all of the codes for practicing and understanding's sake and modified some of them for styling issues and running with my python and openCV version. Needless to say, all the merits belong to Satya Mallick and all the bugs and bad representation are incorprated by me. Typical modifications are:

- change 'xrange' to 'range'
- write some required functions to get the code running independently, e.g. get landmarks directly from the pictures instead of txt files in the orginal codes
- change function naming style to my own
- add some print functions to see how the codes are working, may or maynot commented afterwards
- some addhoc practice while I am learning
- remove commas which might be generated from C++ codes modification
