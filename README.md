# OpenCV Playground

This repository contains codes I used to learn OpenCV, currently the code are a modification of the great blog "www.learnopencv.com", please do visit the link to see how Satya Mallick explains each algorithm in an elegant, insightful and fascinating manner. I list the code here to documents what I have learnt but want to give credit where credit is due. The copyright however belongs to the great Satya Mallick. Thanks to the author's generosity for sharing his codes along with his lucid explanations. 

To get the most of the exercise, I basically hand coded all of the codes for practicing and understanding's sake and modified some of them for styling issues and running with my python and openCV version. Needless to say, all the merits belong to Satya Mallick and all the bugs and bad representation are incorprated by me. Typical modifications are:

- version related modification, e.g. 'xrange' to 'range'
- write some required functions to get the code running independently, e.g. get landmarks directly from the pictures instead of txt files in the orginal codes
- change functions and variables naming style to be my own
- add some print functions to see how the codes are working
- some addhoc practices and comments while learning
- remove commas which might be generated from C++ codes modification
